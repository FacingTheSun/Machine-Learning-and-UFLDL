Machine_Learning-Coursera
=========================

Here contains the lectures and notes while I learning MOOCs in Coursera, Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, and my honor code as programming exercises.

In this course, you would get a intuition about some basic algorithms. Such as regression (linear & logistic), Neural Networks, SVM (support vector machine), and Clustering (K-means),etc. Moreover, you would also learn how to evaluate a machine learning system, or how well it perform.

MATLAB is what we use in this course.

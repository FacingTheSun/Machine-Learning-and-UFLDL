The auto-encoder algorithm, and its solid mathematical analysis and deduction are definitely important to everyone who is interested in this area.\r\n\r\nIn this part, I would commit all exercises I've done in learning UFLDL. Also I would upload all materials I've read, including the materials on the web and my notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Machine Learning\r\n\r\nHere contains the lectures and notes while I learning MOOCs in Coursera, Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, and my honor code as programming exercises.\r\n\r\nIn this course, you would get a intuition about some basic algorithms. Such as regression (linear & logistic), Neural Networks, SVM (support vector machine), and Clustering (K-means),etc. Moreover, you would also learn how to evaluate a machine learning system, or how well it perform.\r\n\r\nMATLAB is what we use in this course. I strongly recommend you to go over the video lectures of the course, and complete the revirw questions and programming exercies assigned every week.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Instruction\r\n\r\nThe PDF file is a step-by-step instruction which helps you to complete the assignment and it's also a reading materials for you. Just run my main m-file, it would be okay.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}

<p>This page contains my notes while learning Machine Learning(Coursera) and UFLDL by Stanford.</p>

<a name="ufldl" class="anchor" href="#ufldl"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>UFLDL</h3>

<p>UFLDL, Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning, changes my experience in Machine Learning tremendously. The auto-encoder algorithm, and its solid mathematical analysis and deduction are definitely important to everyone who is interested in this area.</p>

<p>In this part, I would commit all exercises I've done in learning UFLDL. Also I would upload all materials I've read, including the materials on the web and my notes.</p>

<h3>
<a name="machine-learning" class="anchor" href="#machine-learning"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Machine Learning</h3>

<p>Here contains the lectures and notes while I learning MOOCs in Coursera, Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, and my honor code as programming exercises.</p>

<p>In this course, you would get a intuition about some basic algorithms. Such as regression (linear &amp; logistic), Neural Networks, SVM (support vector machine), and Clustering (K-means),etc. Moreover, you would also learn how to evaluate a machine learning system, or how well it perform.</p>

<p>MATLAB is what we use in this course. I strongly recommend you to go over the video lectures of the course, and complete the revirw questions and programming exercies assigned every week.</p>

<h4>
<a name="instruction" class="anchor" href="#instruction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Instruction</h4>

<p>The PDF file is a step-by-step instruction which helps you to complete the assignment and it's also a reading materials for you. Just run my main m-file, it would be okay.</p>
